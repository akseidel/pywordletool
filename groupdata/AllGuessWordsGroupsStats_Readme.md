### All Guess Words Groups Stats

#### Introduction
* The **AllGuessWordsGroupsStats.csv.txt** is a comma separated value format text file summarizing the word grouping performance for every word in the Wordle allowed guess word list used as a guess for every possible Wordle solution. This is the resulting situation for every possible word used for the first Wordle guess word.

* Using this file one can evaluate the merit for a game's first word.

* This list is sorted according to the number of word groups generated (descending), then by the maximum group size (ascending) and then by the average group size (ascending).
* The **Group Driller** **Condensed** verbose output created the content shown in this list.
