# All Guess Words Groups Stats

## Introduction

* The [AllGuessWordsGroupsStats.csv.txt](/groupdata/AllGuessWordsGroupsStats.csv.txt) is a comma separated value format text file summarizing the word grouping performance for every word in the Wordle allowed guess word list used as a guess ***for the starting state where every possible Wordle solution can be the days' Wordle solution***. Data is based upon using the classic 2,309 possible Wordle solutions.

* The data can help one evaluate the merit for a game's first word only. After the first guess is played the list of possible Wordle solutions reduces to a list of remaining possible Wordle solutions. **AllGuessWordsGroupsStats.csv.txt** no longer applies after the first guess.  

* Data is sorted according to the number of word groups generated (descending), then by the maximum group size (ascending) and then by the average group size (ascending).

* The list columns are:
  * guess - This is the guess word.
  * qty   - The number of word groups the guess divides the possible Wordle solution words. As of this file there are 2309 solution words. The guess word identically matches or mismatches all the words in each word group.
  * min   - The number of words in the smallest word group.
  * max   - The number of words in the largest word group. The largest word group is often the words having nothing in common with the guess word.
  * ave   - The average size of all the word groups.
  * wrds/max    - The number of times larger the 2039 solution word is above the maximum group size. This value may have no bearing on the guess's merit, but it does provide a comparison means. (Newer **Group Driller** output no longer shows this statistic.)
* The following list columns are present in more recent **Group Driller** versions:
  * ent   - The word groups' unbiased entropy bit. The NYT Wordlebot refers to this as 'Information Bits'. 'Bits' means the entropy value is in powers of 2. Unbiased means every word in the word groups is considered equally likely to be a solution.
  * exp   - The remaining words group size outcome expected for the guess.
  * p2   - The word groups' size population variance.

* The **Group Driller** **Condensed** verbose output created the content shown in this list. A more recent version for **Group Driller** **Condensed** verbose output includes groups entropy (ent), resulting group expected size (exp), groups size population variance (p2) and omits the wrds/max. These added groups characteristics are more informative for evaluating a first word's guess merit. The file, [ClassicPatternGrpGuessesLarge.txt](/groupdata/ClassicPatternGrpGuessesLarge.txt), is based upon the newer version output for guesses from the large vocabulary words list (14,855 words) into the Classic possible solutions list (2,309 words).

* The concept of **Wordle Groups** is explained in an allegory here: [Groups Allegory](/groupsallegory/README.md)

## Observations

* The data is sorted first by group quantity and then by maximum group quantity. As such the better guess, measured by the maximum group quantity, amongst those words generating the same number of groups as a category are the words in that category having the most commonly used letters "AE,NOSTRIL". Such words would be the best guess within the quantity category. This characteristic is what results in the red stripes seen in the graphed data.

### Other Data

* [PatternGrpGuessesLarge.txt](/groupdata/PatternGrpGuessesLarge.txt)  - Unbiased groups' data generated by the **Large** vocabulary, ie ***all*** the allowed Wordle words, applied as first guesses to the **Classic+** vocabulary. This list shows technically better performing first guesses because it includes guesses that would not be solutions but more efficiently divide the solutions than the solutions themselves. This data is sorted by groups **ent** and includes the groups expected size **exp** and groups population variance **p2**.

* [ClassicPatternGrpGuessesLarge.txt](/groupdata/ClassicPatternGrpGuessesLarge.txt)  - Unbiased groups' data generated by the **Large** vocabulary, ie ***all*** the allowed Wordle words, applied as first guesses to the **Classic** vocabulary. This list shows the technically best performing first guesses using the **Classic** vocabulary for guesses. The **Classic** vocabulary, because it does not include words that the NYT WordleBot padded its Possible Solutions list, ie the **Classic+** vocabulary, many words of which arguably would never be the solution, in essence causes the groups' data to some degree resemble the biased NYT WordleBot's groups' data versions.
