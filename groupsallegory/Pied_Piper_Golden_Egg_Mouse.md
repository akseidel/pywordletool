# Pied Piper and Mouse That Lays Golden Eggs Allegory

You are the Pied Piper wanting to catch the mouse that lays golden eggs. This mouse looks like any other mouse. When hearing a tune mice, group up to dance in circles according to how they like the tune. When you march away playing the tune the one dancing mice group with the special mouse follows you. The other mice groups stay behind. 

You can play many tunes to observe how many dancing mouse groups there are before you decide which tune to play when marching away. You can then repeat the process after marching away with the now smaller group of mice that you know must include the fancy mouse. 

Would you decide on the one tune that has one mouse dancing by itself while all the other mice dance in one large group, or would you decide on a tune that has many small groups of dancing mice? Remember, you do not know which mouse lays the golden eggs. But you do know the one dancing group with that mouse will follow you.

When you repeat the dancing process, did same notes matter? You were not trying to guess the notes or the tune like you maybe how you Wordle. Instead, you were noticing which tunes reduce the number of mice until there is one remaining. That is how you catch the mouse that lays golden eggs.
