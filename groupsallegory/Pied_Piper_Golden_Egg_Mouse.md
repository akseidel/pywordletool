# Pied Piper and Mouse That Lays Golden Eggs Allegory

You are the Pied Piper wanting to catch the mouse that lays golden eggs. This mouse looks like any other mouse. All the mice like to hear tunes. The mice group up to dance in circles according to how they like tunes they hear. For example mice that like the tune in a certain way dance together in a group while mice that like the tune in a specific different way dance in their own group. One dancing mouse group will follow you when you march away playing any tune. That group is always the dancing group that includes the special mouse. All the other mice groups stay behind.

You can play many tunes to observe how many dancing mouse groups there are before you decide which tune to play when marching away. Later on after marching away with the now smaller group you can repeat the process as many times as needed to further reduce the size of the dancing groups. You know at each step the special mouse has to be in that ever decreasing group that follows you until eventually there is one mouse following you. That mouse has to be the fancy mouse.

Would you decide on the one tune that has one mouse dancing by itself while all the other mice dance in one large group, or would you decide on a tune that has many small groups of dancing mice? Remember, you do not know which mouse lays the golden eggs and you do not know which dancing group will follow you. You do know the one dancing group with that mouse will follow you as you march away playing a tune.

When you repeat the dancing process, did same notes matter? You were not trying to guess the notes or the tune like you maybe how you Wordle. Instead, you were noticing which tunes reduce the number of mice until there is one remaining. That is how you catch the mouse that lays golden eggs.
