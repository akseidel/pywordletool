The Wordle helper shows five-letter words from which you can select for playing the Wordle game.

- Word Ranking Method:

The five-letter words are assigned a rank according to how common the letters are in the English Wordle words. The 'Occurrence' method does not consider where letters occur in the word. The 'Position' method considers the letter's position. The 'Both' method adds the other two rank values. This helper presents the ranked words from the lowest rank to the highest rank. The word list always shows scrolled to the highest ranking words at its bottom. Scroll the list upwards to see the lower ranking words.

Word rank represents relative occurrence probability; however, any word matching the filter could be the Wordle word regardless of its rank.

- Word Filtering:

The 'Allow Duplicate Letters' option includes words having duplicate letters. After your first or second Wordle choice you should start to consider words with duplicate letters. Depending on your known letters status, duplicate letters ought to be shown before making the third selection.

Checking 'Letters To Be Excluded' letter check boxes results in words not containing those letters.

Checking 'Letters To Be Required' letter check boxes results in words containing those letters. No words will show when six or more letters are required for the word.

The Clear button in the check box lineups clears all the check boxes in that lineup. The letter check boxes are ordered according to letter use frequency. The vertical lines indicate a jump in letter use frequency and are useful to describe letter rank group types. The group descriptions in turn provide a language useful for discussing game strategy and game results.

'Letter Positioning' is where letters may be excluded or required for one of the five possible Wordle word letter positions. For each requirement, select the letter and position. The plus (+) and minus (-) buttons add or remove the respective position requirement. The Z buttons clear the entire position list.

In the puzzle game context a letter indicated not at its correct position is a letter known to be present in the word, so it will also be required. For such letters, its checkbox will not appear checked in 'Letters To Be Required', but its filter requirement will be applied. If perhaps you want to follow a strict letter elimination strategy, and you want the helper word list to not include unknown position letters, then use the letter's 'Letters To Be Excluded' check box and do not apply an 'Exclude From Position' for that letter. Otherwise, the word list will be empty because no word can have the letter and also not have the letter.

'Special Pattern' allows one to quickly introduce a custom require or exclude filter pattern that can operate on letter position. 'Special Pattern' was initially intended for adjacent letter patterns such as TT, ITE, GHT or SS. One might use this to compare the number of words having a SS pattern versus S.S or S..S patterns where the "." means 'any letter'. The pattern S..S shows words having any two letters between S letters like the words SMUSH and TSARS. 'Special Pattern' turns out to be especially useful for spotting words groups in part because its setting is independent of the Exclude and Require Position controls. Thus you can very quickly set and then clear 'Special Pattern' without affecting one's thought train. 

'Pick A Random Word' highlights a random word in the current showing word list. There is a point when narrowing down the list of possible words where the higher ranking words are biased against words containing low ranking letters. Any one of the words shown could be the Wordle word. This feature is intended for use when the list has become small where you can surmise the correct word would be a random selection.

'Show Highest Genetic Rank' highlights the words or words having the highest Genetic Rank in the current word list. Genetic Rank is a measure of how related via its letters a word is to other words amongst a word group. Using the highest genetic ranking word minimizes the worst possible outcome. In a simple example consider a word group of three words. The worst possible outcome is three guesses. If there is one or two highest genetic ranking words in this group, then picking one of those words first reduces the worst possible outcome to two guesses. Multiple highlighted highest genetic rank words may not be visible all at once in the words list. Slowly scroll the words list to find the other highlighted words.

'Show Group Optimal' highlights the word or words that result in the lowest average resulting group rank when that word is used as a guess. The rank is the guess's maximum resulting group size added to the guess's average resulting group size. This analysis is performed on the current displayed words. The computation process is intensive and may take extended time to finish. The group optimal guess word is likely to result in remaining smaller word groups, thus increasing chances to find the solution in fewer guesses.

- Tips:

Please develop your own strategy for picks. Sorry, none are mentioned here. What you discover might be surprising at first.

When adding a new exclusion position for a letter that already has an excluded position, first select that letter's exclusion in the list. That selection puts the letter in the combobox so that you need only to indicate the letter position before pressing the plus (+) button.

Seeing an empty list can seem to be an error at times. No, it is not an error. The criteria you entered resulted in the empty list. A simple example is 'Excluding' a letter and then also 'Requiring' that same letter. The filtering happens in discrete stages. In the simple example, the resulting list of words that exclude a letter is then asked to list words having that same letter. There would be none.

'Exclude From Position' in the 'Letter Positioning' options applies letter requirements for letters you indicate for position exclusion. This is actually two separate filter commands. The letter is required in the word, but not at the position indicated. Wordle uses Yellow color blocks for such letters. In subsequent guesses, Wordle marks that same previously marked Yellow color letter as Grey color when that letter is not in the correct position and when the guess has erroneous multiple instances of that same letter. 'Exclude From Position' such letters. Do not apply the broad brush 'Excluding' for such letters. An empty list results if you do as just previously explained.
