The five-letter words are assigned a rank according to how common the letters are in the English wordle words. This helper presents ranked words from lowest rank to highest rank. Scroll the list upwards to see the lower ranking words.

Word rank represents relative occurrence probability; however, any word matching the filter could be the wordle word regardless of its rank.

The 'Allow Duplicate Letters' option includes words having duplicate letters. After your first or second wordle choice you should start to consider words with duplicate letters. Depending on your known letters status, duplicate letters ought to be shown before making the third selection.

Checking 'Letters To Be Excluded' checkboxes results in words not containing those letters.

Checking 'Letters To Be Required' checkboxes results in words containing those letters. No words will show when six or more letters are required for the word.

The 'Apply Your Thinking' button needs to be pressed to recognize changes to checkboxes. The Z button clears the checkboxes.

'Letters Positioning' is where letters may be excluded or required for one of the five possible wordle word letter positions. For each requirement, select the letter and position. The plus (+) and minus (-) buttons add or remove the respective position requirement. In puzzle context a letter not at its correct position is a letter known to be present in the word, so it will also be required. The letter's checkbox will not appear checked in 'Letters To Be Required'. Z buttons clear the position list.

One might not use 'Letter Positioning' settings until after letter elimination strategy picks have been made to avoid its interference with letter exclusion settings.
