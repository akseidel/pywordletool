The wordle helper shows five-letter words from which you can select for playing the wordle game.

- Word Ranking:

The five-letter words are assigned a rank according to how common the letters are in the English wordle words. The 'Occurrence' method does not consider where letters occur in the word. The 'Position' method considers the letter's position. The 'Both' method adds the other two rank values. This helper presents the ranked words from the lowest rank to the highest rank. The word list always shows scrolled to the highest ranking words at its bottom. Scroll the list upwards to see the lower ranking words.

Word rank represents relative occurrence probability; however, any word matching the filter could be the wordle word regardless of its rank.

- Word Filtering:

The 'Allow Duplicate Letters' option includes words having duplicate letters. After your first or second wordle choice you should start to consider words with duplicate letters. Depending on your known letters status, duplicate letters ought to be shown before making the third selection.

Checking 'Letters To Be Excluded' letter check boxes results in words not containing those letters.

Checking 'Letters To Be Required' letter check boxes results in words containing those letters. No words will show when six or more letters are required for the word.

The Clear button in the check box lineups clears all the check boxes in that lineup. The letter check boxes are ordered according to letter use frequency. The vertical lines indicate a jump in letter use frequency and are useful to describe letter rank group types. The group descriptions in turn provide a language useful for discussing game strategy and game results.

'Letter Positioning' is where letters may be excluded or required for one of the five possible wordle word letter positions. For each requirement, select the letter and position. The plus (+) and minus (-) buttons add or remove the respective position requirement. The Z buttons clear the entire position list.

In the puzzle game context a letter indicated not at its correct position is a letter known to be present in the word, so it will also be required. For such letters, its checkbox will not appear checked in 'Letters To Be Required', but the requirement will be applied. If perhaps you want to follow a strict letter elimination strategy, and you want the helper word list to not include unknown position letters, then use the letter's 'Letters To Be Excluded' check box and do not apply an 'Exclude From Position' for that letter. Otherwise, the word list will be empty because no word can have the letter and also not have the letter.

'Special Pattern' allows one to quickly introduce a custom require or exclude filter pattern that can operate on letter position. It is primarily intended for adjacent letter patterns such as TT, ITE, GHT or SS. One might use this to compare the number of words having a SS pattern versus S.S or S..S patterns where the "." means 'any letter'. The pattern S..S shows words having any two letters between S letters like the words SMUSH and TSARS.

'Pick A Random Word' colors red a random word in the current showing word list. There is a point when narrowing down the list of possible words where the higher ranking words are biased against words containing low ranking letters. Any one of the words shown could be the wordle word. Scroll up in the word list if the word is not visible. This feature is intended for use when the list has become small where you can surmise the correct word would be a random selection.

- Tips:

Please develop your own strategy for picks. Sorry, none are mentioned here. What you discover might be surprising at first.

When adding a new exclusion position for a letter that already has an excluded position, first select that letter's exclusion in the list. That selection puts the letter in the combobox so that you need only to indicate the letter position before pressing the plus (+) button.

Seeing an empty list can seem to be an error at times. No, it is not an error. The criteria you entered resulted in the empty list. A simple example is 'Excluding' a letter and then also 'Requiring' that same letter. The filtering happens in discrete stages. In the simple example, the resulting list of words that exclude a letter is then asked to list words having that same letter. There would be none.
