# Word List Information

The original Wordle maintained two word lists. One list contained 2,309 words that would be solution words. The other list contained 12,546 words that would never be solutions. Both lists combined are 14,855 words that are accepted as valid Wordle guesses.

Subsequent to the NYT taking control over Wordle and Wordlebot, these two lists essentially still exist. The overall 14,855 valid entry words remains untouched. The 14,855 words divide into two categories. One word category are words the Wordlebot considers possible solutions. The list of Wordlebot possible solutions consists of the original 2,309 words less a few original words the NYT considers socially unsuitable plus words that were formerly never to be solutions.

The Classic word list is the original 2,309 words. This is file **wo_nyt_wordlist.txt**. This list still contains the NYT unsuitable words.

The Classic+ word list is the word list Wordlebot considers possible solutions. This list is as described above. The NYT occasionally adds words and removes words from this list. File **botadd_nyt_wordlist.txt** is this list. The file **bot_added_wordlist.txt** contains the words the NYT transferred from the original 12,546 never to be solution list to the possible solution list.

The full 14,855 word list is the file **nyt_wordlist.txt**.
